# Emergency-Traffic-Management-And-Congestion-Prediction-Using-ML

## 🚦 Project Description

This project leverages **Machine Learning (ML)** and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to optimize traffic management for emergency vehicles by predicting congestion and suggesting real-time route adjustments. The model is trained using **NYC Open Data** and employs a **Random Forest Regressor (RFR)** for traffic volume prediction.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1️⃣ Preprocess historical traffic data, including features such as timestamp, geographic coordinates, borough, direction, and traffic volume.  
2️⃣ Train a **Random Forest Regressor** to accurately predict traffic congestion patterns.  
3️⃣ Utilize real-time GPS coordinates to track ambulance location during emergencies.  
4️⃣ Predict congestion levels dynamically and provide recommendations to traffic authorities for deploying emergency lanes or taking appropriate traffic control measures.

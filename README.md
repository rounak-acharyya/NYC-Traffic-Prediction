Project Title : Create software using AI and ML that helps clear traffic for ambulances and other emergency vehicles by analyzing live traffic data, predicting jams, and giving suggestions to traffic authorities for quick and efficient route management.

Project Description : This project leverages Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to optimize traffic management for emergency vehicles by predicting congestion and suggesting real-time route adjustments. The model is trained using NYC Open Data and employs a Random Forest Regressor (RFR) for traffic volume prediction.

How It Works? 

1️. Preprocess historical traffic data, including features such as timestamp, geographic coordinates, borough, direction, and traffic volume.

2️. Train a Machine Learning model (Random Forest Regressor) to accurately predict traffic congestion patterns.

3️. Utilize real-time GPS coordinates to track ambulance location during emergencies.

4️. Predict congestion levels dynamically and provide recommendations to traffic authorities for deploying emergency lanes or taking appropriate traffic control measures.
